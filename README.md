This is a sandbox repo for working with node apps.  Mostly for interacting with mongo and/or SQL db's.

template2.js is an example of transforming csv to json and then BASIC mapping over of celerant fields into Reaction key/value pairs.
I used JSONpath and jsonpath-object-transform.

There is also another package that works with lodash.  
node-json-transform.
